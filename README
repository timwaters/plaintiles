This is a simple sinatra app for making plain one colour tiles for mapping applications

It generates plain colour 256x256 tiles in response to a resquest like http://example.com/red/1/3/4.png

It used imagemagick to generate the colours and so all valid colour names from http://www.imagemagick.org/script/color.php#color_names are valid. For example:

wheat,
snow4,
red,
HotPink1

etc

It was developed in response to a GeoCommons user wanting a plain tile backgroud to show their data upon, and as an exercise for me getting to know the Heroku platform - for which this application should work.

There is a deployed version of this application at:
